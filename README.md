# My Personal Portfolio Website

Hey! I made this portfolio website during my second semester studying BSc Web Development & Cyber Security. I tried to keep things simple but still make it look professional.

## What's Inside
- Home page where I introduce myself
- Projects page with some stuff I've worked on
- Skills page showing what I know how to do
- Contact page if you want to reach out
- Video showing how the website works
- Site report with all the technical details

## Tools Used
- HTML5 for the basic structure
- CSS3 for making it look nice
  - Flexbox and Grid to arrange things
  - Some cool animations when you click around
  - Works on phones and computers :)

## Some Cool Features
- Things move smoothly when you hover over them
- Nice clean menu at the top
- Project cards that look neat
- Simple contact form
- Image viewer for the validation stuff
- Pretty gradient backgrounds

## How It's Organized
- index.html - Where you land first
- projects.html - Shows my work
- skills.html - Lists what I know
- contact.html - How to reach me
- videoDemo.html - See the site in action
- sitereport.html - All the technical stuff

## Where I'm At
Got the main parts done:
- Basic structure
- All the styling
- Works on different screens
- Added all the content

Just need to polish things up a bit!

## Should Work On
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- And so on!
