# My Personal Portfolio Website

Hey there! üëã This is my portfolio website that I built during my second semester of BSc Web Development & Cyber Security. I wanted to create something simple yet professional to show off my work.

## What's Inside

- Projects page showing what I've worked on
- Skills section displaying what I know
- Contact form to get in touch with me
- Video demo of the website
- About page with my site report

## Tools I Used
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
  - Flexbox and Grid for layouts
  - Animations for smooth interactions
  - Responsive design that works on phones and computers

## Cool Features
- Smooth animations when hovering over elements
- Clean and modern navigation menu
